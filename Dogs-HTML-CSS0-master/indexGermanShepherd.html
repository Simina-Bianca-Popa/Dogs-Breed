                        <p>The German Shepherd, is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog 
                            that originated in Germany. The breed was officially known as the Alsatian in the UK from after 
                            the First World War until 1977 when its name was changed back to German Shepherd. 
                            Despite its primitive, wolf-like appearance the German Shepherd is a relatively modern breed of dog, 
                            with their origin dating to 1899.</p>
